# Welcome to BackLang
*The programming language where everything is backwards. If you hate coding, this will make you want to quit.*

---

## Introduction
BackLang is a revolutionary programming language designed to make your coding experience as unintuitive as possible. By reversing the order of common programming constructs, BackLang challenges you to think in reverse and type like a linguistic gymnast. Whether you're here for a brain workout or to frustrate your coworkers, BackLang has you covered.

## Basic Syntax Rules
1. **Reverse Keyword Order**  
   Every statement **must** be written with the keyword **at the end**.  
   Example:  
10 = x let;
   - First, specify the value (`10`).  
  - Next, write the variable (`x`).  
  - Finally, conclude with the keyword (`let`).  

2. **Semicolons Are Still Mandatory**  
Statements end with a semicolon (`;`), just like traditional programming languages. Consistency matters... sometimes.

3. **Mathematical Operations Are Reversed**  
Write mathematical operations backwards.  
Example:  
  5 3 + result let;
Explanation:  
- Begin with the operands (`5` and `3`).  
- Add the operator (`+`).  
- Assign the result to a variable (`result`).  

4. **Function Calls Are Backwards**  
Arguments come first, and the function name comes last.  
Example:  
  "Hello, BackLang!" print;
5. **Program End Declaration**  
Every program **must** end with the keyword `finish;`, because BackLang doesn’t trust you to know when to stop.

## Definitions
"Hello, BackLang!" print;
### Variables  
Variables are declared in reverse order. Use the `let` keyword **at the end**.  
Example:  
  10 = x let;
  
### Printing Values  
To print a value, say what you want to print first, then the `print` keyword.  
Example:  
  "Welcome to BackLang!" print;
  
### Conditional Logic  
Conditional statements follow a backwards structure.  
Example:  
  { "x is greater!" print; } 5 > x if;
  
### Loops  
Loops are written in reverse.  
Example:  
  { "Looping!" print; } 10 < x while;

### Functions  
Functions are defined and called in reverse.  
Example:  
  y x add func;

  { x y + return; } func add define;

## Operators
BackLang supports these operators (backwards, of course):  
| Operator     | Symbol      | Example                 |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Addition     | `+`         | `5 3 + result let;`     |
| Subtraction  | `-`         | `10 4 - result let;`    |
| Multiplication | `*`       | `6 2 * result let;`     |
| Division     | `/`         | `20 5 / result let;`    |
| Equality     | `=`         | `10 = x let;`           |

## Comments
Use the word `LOL` for comments. Everything after `LOL` is ignored by the parser.  
Example:  
10 = x let; LOL Declare x with value 10 "Hello, world!" print; LOL Print a greeting

---

## Example Program
Here’s a simple BackLang program that combines all the features:  
  10 = x let; LOL Declare x with value 10 "Hello, world!" print; LOL Print a greeting { "x is greater than 5!" print; } 5 < x if; LOL Conditional check "Done!" print; LOL Program finished finish;

## Why BackLang?  
1. To confuse your coworkers.  
2. To teach you patience (or test it).  
3. Because normal programming is too easy.

*Happy backwards coding!*
